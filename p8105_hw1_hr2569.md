## 1. Dataset interpretation

The dataset describes Hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK and EWR
for the month of January 2013.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

1a. The variables in the dataset are origin, year, month, day, hour,
temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
visib, time_hour

Mean and sd for specific variables are listed below

| Variables    | mean       | sd         |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| *temp*       | 39.5821229 | 7.058637   |
| *dewp*       | 28.057095  | 10.7260695 |
| *humid*      | 65.4767039 | 18.9453049 |
| *wind_speed* | 8.2258269  | 4.6116356  |
| *precip*     | 0.0020391  | 0.0132008  |
| *visib*      | 8.5153352  | 2.9971051  |

1b. The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns

1c. The mean temperature is 39.5821229

## 2. Scatterplot

Draw a scatterplot of `temp` and `time_hour`.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, 
       aes(y = temp, x = time_hour, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_hr2569_files/figure-gfm/temp&time_hour_scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

From the scatterplot, we can see that temperature rises in flucuations
over time. And the daily temperatureâ€™s range were similar.

Now we save the scatterplot.
